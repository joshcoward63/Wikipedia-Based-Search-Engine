**Implementation of Text Processing :**

For the implementation of this project we used a lot of code from the previous homeworks as a starting point. The tokenizer we used was once again the work\_tokenize from nltk and again we opted for lemmatization rather than stemming in our preprocessing using nltk‚Äôs WordNetLemmatizer. This was due to the fact that stemming resulted in a lack of meaning which makes it harder to return relevant results. We also used ntlks english stopword list in which we had appended punctuation to it to help remove the /r and /n present in the content of each document.

**Statistics on Document Collection:**

The number of documents present: 1,286,264 Index size prior to preprocessing: 244,435,249 Index size after preprocessing: 2,651,233

**Implementation of Query Suggestions:**

To implement query suggestions, we imported the query log into a dataframe to make manipulating the data easier. In this case, it was simpler to use a dataframe but to make it more efficient a dictionary could be used. We wrote a method that takes the query as a parameter and outputs all queries that begin with the input (excluding an exact match, as suggesting the inputted query would be pointless). These results are sorted by frequency, so the queries that q‚Äô are most often modified to are presented first, as intended by the ùëÜùëêùëúùëüùëí(ùê∂ùëÑ, ùëû‚Ä≤) equation.

**Implementation of Ranking:**

Like instructed, the way we went about coming up with our ranking system was by using the inverted\_index which in our case consisted of a dictionary where the key was equal to the specific word and the value was equal to a list of all the documents that the word could be found in. In our case we opted to account for the number of occurrences of each word in a particular document later outside the inverted\_index in the case if the word appeared in the query in order to achieve a faster and more efficient computation.

To rank results, first we would read in the users query. The query was then cleaned to fit the preprocessing that all the words in the inverted index had experienced. From there we created a list of documents that consisted of all the documents in common between the query terms. If there were less than 50 documents in total we would take whatever documents remained in the query term that resulted in the least amount of total documents that that word was found in. We did this because the word with less occurrences was seen as more rare and therefore a better use in finding accurate results rather than using the more common query term.

From there we performed the actual ranking portion given a list of potential candidate documents retrieved from the previous step and ranked them similarly to how we ranked documents in homework 4: by taking the number of occurrences of a word in a document and dividing that number by the total number of words in that document. That value was then multiplied by the total number of documents in which the word appeared and divided by the total number of documents in the collection. For any word that was unseen before and or not in the inverted index a smoothing value of 0.00001 was applied in order to avoid errors due to dividing by 0.

The documents were then added to a dictionary where the key was the Document ID number and the value was the probability of getting that document given the query in question. This dictionary was then sorted by descending order of value. Then a second dictionary was made and where the key was once again the document ID number and the value was a nested dictionary where the first key was the title of the document and the

corresponding value was the actual title of that document. The second and last key in the nested dictionary‚Äôs key was content and it‚Äôs value consisted of the result of the cosine similarity between the query and the content of the document where the result was a sentence that contained the most related sentence to the query.This value was then sent over flask to an html page to be displayed in the browser.

The purpose of using dictionaries in this project served multiple purposes. One being that it allowed a lookup time of O(1) which is about as fast as you can get. Also flask will only allow dictionaries and strings to be sent over to an ajax function in javascript so using a dictionary was a must.

**Implementation of snippet generation:**

To generate snippets of relevant documents, we found the two sentences with the highest cosine similarity score with the query in each document. Originally, we used a dataframe to store this information but we chose to switch to a dictionary for efficiency, as the previous method slowed the calculation of results. To calculate the cosine similarity, we used the sklearn library‚Äôs TfIdfVectorizor function to create a matrix of TF-IDF scores for each word in the query and each sentence in a document. We also used sklearn‚Äôs cosine\_similarity function to compare the relevancy of sentences, using the TF-IDF matrix as input, as it is an efficient implementation of the calculation that uses smoothing to avoid division by zero.

In some documents, there may be only one sentence that is of importance to the user based on the query. In these cases, we chose to only return one sentence instead of presenting one relevant sentence and one irrelevant sentence, as we felt that is more practical for a user.

We used the above query as just a basic test for the search engine, the intent was to see if we actually got results that had the bigram ‚Äúfried chicken‚Äù in it just to see that it was working as intended. From the results it would appear that we had retrieved relevant documents.

The intent behind the above query was to find relevant recipes for fried chicken. Looking at the results it looks like our search engine was on the right track as the top results contained steps in making fried chicken.

However, none of the results contained information on quantities and any real linear start to finish path for making fried chicken but just generally how it was made at a restaurant. This is probably just a dataset issue more than anything.

| :- | :- | - | :- |
The intent in the query above was to retrieve information on former president Donald Trump. The results were questionable in this case as certainly the top results contain instances of the ‚Äúdonald trump‚Äù in them, but the content of them was quite short so there was a lack of information.



|**Query:**||Barack Obama||

Like the previous query, the intent in the query above was to retrieve information on the past president Barack Obama in hopes to find better results than were found for Donald Trump. Again the results were questionable but slightly better then the previous query as there was more specific information about Barack than Donald but still the overall content of each document was pretty small.



|**Query:**||Pizza||

Lastly as the unigram test we tested the query ‚Äúpizza‚Äù  to see what information we could get on it. In this case given that we only searched for pizza without any sort of context I would say the results were very good as they consisted of either restaurant information that served pizza or an actual definition of pizza.

Overall based on the results from each of the individual queries I would say that the results were as good as one could expect using our ranking algorithm and the given dataset. For certain queries such as the ones that consisted of past president names the results were slightly underwhelming in that they didn‚Äôt possess as much information on the president as I would hope. The top results just happened to be a sentence long which just makes the ratio of the president's name high in the document being that there's only a handful of words in total in the first place. So it makes sense that we got those results. For the other queries like fried chicken/fried chicken recipes and pizza I was honestly impressed how good the results were. Most of them weren‚Äôt short in content length and actually contained information one might hope to retrieve given this dataset. As far as the project goes overall I would say in general it went rather smoothly. The biggest issue we ran into and will most certainly try to address for project 2 is dealing with and processing such a large dataset. There were multiple times when preprocessing functions had to be rewritten in order to achieve a realistic computation time relative to when the project was due. The decision to compute the number of occurrences of a word in a document during the time of searching rather than with the creation of the inverted index was made so that the inverted index wouldn't take days/weeks to compute. However this did lead to a slower searching time ultimately which we intend to address in the next project as well. To add to that, there was also the issue of running out of RAM due to needing to access the two datasets along with the inverted index on top of the frontend portion. Fortunately due to having access to a physical server this problem was easily fixed when attempting to run the entire project. However for testing we used subsets of the data in order to understand how the program was functioning as we developed it.
